# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is the place holder for a function, while an argument is the value that is passed into the parameter.

Researched answer: The values that are declared within a function when the function is called are known as an argument. Whereas, the variables that are defined when the function is declared are known as a parameter

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: The predefined parameters are Value, index, and array. The optional ones are index and array.

Researched answer: currentValue	Required. The value of the current element. index	Optional. The index of the current element. arr	Optional. The array of the current element.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: Map returns an array with the same length, and filter returns an array with only the needed elements.

Researched answer: map returns the same number of elements as the original, but the element value will be transformed in some way and filter will return the same or less number of elements than the original but not change the original elementsâ€™ values.

1. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the evaluation of each given element until a certain condition is met.

Researched answer: A sequence of instructions or code being repeated until a specific end result is achieved. 

1. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: a Function is a block of code that can be reused in the future, while a method is a built in behavior that will facilitate the code execution.

Researched answer: A function doesn't need any object and is independent, while the method is a function, which is linked with any object. We can directly call the function with its name, while the method is called by the object's name. Function is used to pass or return the data, while the method operates the data in a class

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: I honestly don't recall. But i believe it is connecting multiple methods together.

Researched answer: the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code
